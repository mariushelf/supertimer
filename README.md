# supertimer

Contextmanager to print or log execution time of code blocks

Original url: https://github.com/mariushelf/supertimer


# Etymology

This package provides a timer. But the name `timer` was already taken.
So I needed a new name. Inspired by my recently freshly flamed up
love for the good old Super Nintendo, I thought that this timer could
as well be *super*.
